# Exploring LLM, RAG, and Fine-Tuning Technologies

This repository is dedicated to exploring and experimenting with cutting-edge technologies in the field of natural language processing (NLP), including Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning techniques. The primary focus of this project is to leverage these technologies using locally hosted models, enabling researchers and developers to gain hands-on experience and insights into their functionality and potential applications.

## Key Features

- **LLM Experimentation**: Dive into the world of Large Language Models and investigate their capabilities, such as text generation, question answering, and language understanding. Gain practical knowledge by working with state-of-the-art LLMs in a local environment.

- **RAG Implementation**: Explore Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a powerful technique that combines information retrieval with language generation. Implement RAG models locally and observe how they enhance the quality and relevance of generated text by leveraging external knowledge sources.

- **Fine-Tuning Techniques**: Learn and apply fine-tuning techniques to adapt pre-trained language models to specific domains or tasks. Experiment with different fine-tuning strategies, such as transfer learning and domain adaptation, to improve model performance and create specialized NLP solutions.

- **Local Model Hosting**: Experience the benefits of running language models locally, including data privacy, customization flexibility, and reduced reliance on external APIs. Gain insights into the infrastructure requirements and optimization techniques for efficient local model deployment.

- **Comprehensive Examples**: Explore a wide range of practical examples and use cases that demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs, RAG, and fine-tuning in various NLP tasks, such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and more.

- **Reproducibility and Documentation**: Benefit from detailed documentation, step-by-step tutorials, and well-structured code that ensures reproducibility and facilitates understanding of the implemented techniques. Learn best practices for documenting and sharing your experiments and findings.

## Getting Started

The repository includes detailed documentation, code examples, and pre-trained models to help you quickly set up your local environment and begin exploring LLMs, RAG, and fine-tuning techniques.
To test the code, it is recommended to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. Each folder in the repository has its own dedicated virtual environment and requirements.txt file for easy setup
